# Brickly plugins

These are plugins for [Brickly](https://github.com/EstherMi/ft-brickly-userguide/blob/master/de/brickly/index.md)

Plugins extend the functionality of brickly and add new blocks and new
functions. The plugin infrastructure is still under development and may
change.

## Installation

Since version 1.38 brickly can upload plugins via the main web interface.
In skill leven 5 clicking the "plug" icon will open a menu which allows
to install plugins.

## The plugins

### ftDuino IO - ftduino.xml

This plugin gives brickly access to the IOs of an
[ftDuino](http://ftduino.de) connected via USB to the TXT or
[TX-PI](http://tx-pi.de).

The ftDuino needs to run the [ftduino_direct
sketch](https://github.com/PeterDHabermehl/ftduino_direct).

### ftDuino PCA9685 servo driver - ftduino_PCA9685.xml

This plugin gives brickly access to a [PCA9585 based servo
adapter](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3155362) connected via IÂ²C
to a [ftDuino](http://ftduino.de) which in turn is connected via USB
to the TXT or [TX-PI](http://tx-pi.de).

The ftDuino needs to run the [ftduino_direct
sketch](https://github.com/PeterDHabermehl/ftduino_direct).

Provides blocks to read and write simple files. The new blocks show up
in the custrom (Spezial) category.

An example program looks like:

### test - test.xml

A simple test plugin without a really useful functionalty. This
shows some of the basic plugin concepts and e.g. implements its own
toolbox sub category as well a button inside the toolbox which
directly interacts with the TXT.
